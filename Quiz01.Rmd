#quiz 2d$

#I imported the csv using curl, then loaded dplyr so I could mutate it to contain only first names and last names

```{r}
library(curl)

f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

library(dplyr)

new_d <- filter(d, gender == "Female") %>% select(first_name, last_name, height, weight, zombies_killed)

new_d

short_d <- filter(new_d, height < 65)
  
tall_d <- filter(new_d, height <= 65)

boxplot(zombies_killed ~ height, new_d)


par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

boxplot(short_d$zombies_killed)
boxplot(tall_d$zombies_killed)

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

barplot(short_d$zombies_killed)
barplot(tall_d$zombies_killed)

```

## modify to just contain first+last name of every female surviving zombie apoc
